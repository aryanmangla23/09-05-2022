What have I done since 08/31?

Thursday was last day of work

Friday library then work at home and spend like 4-5 hours doing 17 pages of bio notes which was unironically fun even though i felt like stabbing the txtbook for the amount of charts we have to draw. 

During the those 2 last weekdays somethin was bit off. hmm kay sux. Happy bday kevin 09/01 fax ong spit

Saturday library entire day and soohyuk joined in with me and cilla right when we had lunch at hanlin. This time ordered something that wouldn't murder my tastebuds :D. Also god damn, $4.50 for a cup of nonrefillable coffee D: . Worked pretty efficiently till cilla left and decided to start building the lego she gave me :D. Took like 1.25 hour to build it. Cute af. I placed it on my desk with my rubix cube and deadpool bobble head. I wish it came with a key chain or if there was a hole to attach a key chan onto it. Overall productive day. bro also cilla needs to learn how to like communicate better. any times she says "and" or "also" my heartrate spikes on g. gonna get a heart attack ong :< 

Also SO EXCITED FOR END OF SEPTEMBER cuz ill have a new phone by middle of october. Apple event is on 09/07 and new iphone will prbly be released by mid september. So ill either have new phone by end of september of middle of october. :3

Now on sunday 09/04. worked till riya and beeps came. Had lunch and stuff and then went shopping with them. I spent like like about $130. Then went to set up a surprise bday party for gordon. reached at 7 and spent like an 2 hours baking 2 cakes with the help of emmet in making the mix and me and jacob checking on it every 10 minutes to see it's progress in the oven. 

When gordon came we closed all the lights and hid behind the kitchen. Then when he walked in and turned around we were supposed to scare him right. But only I stood up at the right time and everyone else was behind the kitchen so they didn't know that he turned around. Then I fucking shouted out BRO GT THE FUCK UP LMFAOOOO. failed surprise kinda but who tf cares. Best bday gordy ever had. about 18-20 people.

Harker kids are so chill. Ngl, I felt bad for tiffany cuz she is hosting at her house and abhi/rishi/emmet kept on shitting on her :<. I made sure to apologize to her in their behalf hoping it was nothing serious and she didn't take anything personally from them. I didn't do anything wrong btw i just felt bad and wanted to make sure that she was ok. She was fine and thanked me for checking on her. 

Jessica and Michelle also hella chill and she took ap japanese last year. Like interacting with females that idk > than interacting with like girls ik. cuz I actually like form convos with them, while with like cilla, jamie, and claire it is just "k", "on g". ill try to stop saying it irl and online. 

Harker boys were all chill as well like bro. BASICALLY HARKER COOL KIDS is basically ffs lmfao. Like they are nerds except more outgoing and fun. No limits type of fun. So easy to strike a convo with anyone in the entire party. Everyone was outgoing but one person, Joseph. He was out of his element today or smtng. Anti social for some reason with other kids, but was ok socially with lhs people. Like these harker cool kids are so much more open to be friends with than lhs cool kids. Like can I can't imagine lhs cool kids with them. 

Basically, baked, surprised gordon, ping pong, pizza, soda, ate cake sang hbd song, photos, recording, random gym pics at the mirror and bathroom adventures with all 20 people. Tiffany's house is actually crazy lmfao. Hopefully, will be going to more events with all of them. Made a bunch of good connections with these good people. No regrets. Wait jk, learned something weird. Sierra vista point incident. People are so 2 faced. Deny their own faults smh. 

Then today, 09/05, did work post shit on insta cuz had to post that recreation of me joseph and gordon. so cuteeee :3. More work and work and work. not as productive today tho :<. Slightly pissed off from sntng, but idk i don't want to argue with people that can't see things clearly. 

One wish to all people: Can you speak whatever is on your mind to my face? Stop dancing around? - there is also something bout me that i'd insert, but i cant. Thinking ill create a private deep thoughts diary/feels for only myself.

Also, hopefully I'll meet emily at cupertino library sometime this weekday :DDDDD.
