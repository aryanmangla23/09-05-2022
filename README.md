During the those 2 last weekdays somethin was bit off. hmm kay sux. Happy bday kevin 09/01 fax ong spit

Saturday library entire day and soohyuk joined in with me and cilla right when we had lunch at hanlin. This time ordered something that wouldn't murder my tastebuds :D. Also god damn, $4.50 for a cup of nonrefillable coffee D: . Worked pretty efficiently till cilla left and decided to start building the lego she gave me :D. Took like 1.25 hour to build it. Cute af. I placed it on my desk with my rubix cube and deadpool bobble head. I wish it came with a key chain or if there was a hole to attach a key chan onto it. Overall productive day. bro also cilla needs to learn how to like communicate better. any times she says "and" or "also" my heartrate spikes on g. gonna get a heart attack ong :<
